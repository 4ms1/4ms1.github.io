    <h1>v2.0 (BETA)</h1>

    <p>Kevinnet is mostly hosted as a joke. The owners couldnt be bothered to fix an issue regarding not being able to log into the FTP server, I tried to log in so many times that my ip got blacklisted. After this happened, they announced a shutdown because the admins didnt want to pay for kevinnet.</p>
